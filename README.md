# Iris Dataset Clustering using K-Means

This project performs K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset to group the data points into distinct clusters. The implementation is done in Python, utilizing the scikit-learn library for machine learning and data analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gauravabhishek29/Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML.git
   
# Usage
Run the iris_kmeans_clustering.py script to perform K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset.
The script will display the Elbow Method graph to determine the optimal number of clusters (k).
Based on the Elbow Method, the script will perform K-Means clustering with the optimal k and visualize the clusters.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is available at the following URL:
